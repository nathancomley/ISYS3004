 /* This is about as simple and minimal as I can get the CSS but
    still "style" the page. 

    For the in-class demo this is the process I follow: 
      * style a element (perhaps one rule)
      * save document/CSS
      * open in browser, observe the effects
      * repeat until all elements styled

    I follow a simple strategy for constructing the CSS, start
    form the outermost container, top down, left to right.  This
    process is not critical but gives students a workflow or a "checklist" 
    they can follow to make sure they style all the elements they want.

    Hopefully giving them a process to construct the CSS will make update
    and additions cleaner (easiy to locate elements), and hopefully
    stops elements being repeated the CSS (often causing problems).

    I mention some simple design concepts, but 'stylistic design' is 
    beyond the scope of this unit.  So we keep it simple, consistent 
    colour scheme, one (or two) fonts, links look the same etc.

    body {    /* The outermost container, ALL inner elements will 
      inherit from this styling.  Good place to put defaults, clear
      ALL margins etc */
      width: 700px;  /* arbitrary choice, could do %, but px for now */
      margin: 0 auto;  /* centers the <body> within the page */
      padding: 0;

    /* Colours add to look and feel of page. Colour theory is beyond 
    the scope of this unit. 
    
    Hex colours can be initially confusing so I have used names from: 
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors 

    I have kept the color palette simple, 
      * background either darkgray or light gray
      * text either white or black.
    
    I look at online-tools later in the semester. Could choose a palette
    from one of the many online generators:
